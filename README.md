Project: Django Motor Service 

The vehicle service system is a multi-user web-based application. It is developed using Django framework and pythonâ€™s built-in database i.e. sqlite3. Here, the administrator has complete authority over all customer and mechanics requests and can determine whether or not they can be granted.

About the system

Django Motor Service  is a vehicle maintenance service with three users having their own roles and permissions.
